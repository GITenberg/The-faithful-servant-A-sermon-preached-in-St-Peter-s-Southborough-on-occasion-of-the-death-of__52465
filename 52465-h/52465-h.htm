<h2><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>A
SERMON.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Well done, good and faithful servant; thou
hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over
many things; enter thou into the joy of thy
Lord.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Matthew xxv</span>.
23.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is something very solemn in
the death of any one, but peculiarly solemn in the death of a
minister of God; for when he dies he resigns not his life only,
but his ministry.&nbsp; He gives back the ministerial trust
committed to him.&nbsp; So our revered, and honoured friend, has
not merely fallen asleep in the Lord Jesus; but he has, as it
were, handed back to Him who gave it the sacred stewardship of
God&rsquo;s ministry committed to him by God.</p>
<p>Thus this text seems very appropriate, for it contains the
words of a master who had been faithfully served, to two servants
who had faithfully served him.&nbsp; When they met him face to
face, and resigned the trusts committed to their care, the master
said to each of them, &ldquo;Well done thou good and faithful
servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make
thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy
lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; And it is no unwarranted stretch of the
imagination to believe that a similar welcome was given to our
honoured friend when he breathed forth his spirit, and yielded up
his ministry to Him who had called him by His grace, and
commissioned him for his service.</p>
<p><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>I take
the words therefore as addressed to him at the end of his course,
and we may consider them at expressing the master&rsquo;s
verdict, and the master&rsquo;s welcome.</p>
<p>May God be with us in the study, and may He grant that when we
are gathered into his presence, the same words may be addressed
to ourselves!</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Master&rsquo;s
Verdict</span>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou hast been faithful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It does not say, &ldquo;Thou hast been rich,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;great,&rdquo; or &ldquo;powerful,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;brilliant,&rdquo; but &ldquo;faithful.&rdquo;&nbsp; And it
is remarkable that the master said exactly the same words to the
servant who had the two talents, as he did to the one that had
the five.&nbsp; They were not equally gifted, but both were
declared to be faithful.&nbsp; This is a great encouragement for
those who are conscious that they have not the same gifts as our
venerable father.&nbsp; We may not have his powerful, and
melodious, voice; his intimate acquaintance with our great
English divines; or his marvellous power of exhibiting
truth.&nbsp; We may have only two talents, or perhaps only one,
when he had five; but God may give us grace to be faithful, and
we may faithfully use that one talent to his glory.&nbsp; God
said to Moses, &ldquo;What is that in thine hand?&rdquo;&nbsp;
And, though there was nothing there but a common, rough,
shepherd&rsquo;s rod, God used it for the performance of the
greatest miracles in Israel&rsquo;s history.&nbsp; So he says to
each of us, &ldquo;What is that in thine hand?&rdquo;&nbsp; And
whatever it is, however humble, he gives us the sacred privilege
of using it faithfully in his service.</p>
<p><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>But I do
not want to consider general principles this morning, so much as
to turn your attention to the special case of him whom we have
all known as so faithful a servant of his most blessed Lord and
Saviour.</p>
<p>(1)&nbsp; To appreciate that faithfulness, we must note first,
that <span class="GutSmall">IT BEGAN IN EARLY LIFE</span>.&nbsp;
His was an early call.</p>
<p>There is no age in life at which it does not please God to
call his people to himself.&nbsp; We see people called sometimes
in childhood, sometimes in middle life, and sometimes in old age
when tottering to the grave.&nbsp; It is difficult to say at
which age conversion brings the greatest joy in heaven.&nbsp;
There is a marvellous mercy when the old man who has resisted
every influence throughout a long life, is touched at last by the
love of Christ, and brought with a broken heart to the throne of
grace.&nbsp; But there is also a peculiar joy when the spirited
boy is led in his boyhood to receive the message which his mother
teaches him, and so to spend his whole life that he may say in
his old age, as Obadiah did, &ldquo;I thy servant fear the Lord
from my youth.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now this was the case with our
friend.&nbsp; His faith in the Lord Jesus Christ was not an
afterthought late in life.&nbsp; His father and grandfather were
both pious men; and it was in his father&rsquo;s parish, (for his
father was a clergyman,) and in his father&rsquo;s home, that as
a spirited school boy he was first brought to the Lord.&nbsp;
Even before he went to College he began to conduct cottage
lectures in his father&rsquo;s parish.&nbsp; That ministry
therefore to which you used to listen with such intense interest,
contained the ripened experience of a <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>long life, from the beginning
consecrated to God.&nbsp; Is there not a lesson in this for
fathers and mothers?&nbsp; Is there not an encouragement to train
up those committed to them in the Lord?&nbsp; Is there not an
illustration of the truth of the promise, &ldquo;Train up a child
in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart
from it?&rdquo;&nbsp; And is there not a word also for young
men?&nbsp; Does it not call on them to begin early, and to begin
at once, and in the midst of all the play, and all the work of
early life, to fall down before God&rsquo;s footstool, and cry,
&ldquo;Lord save me, Lord make me thine, now, at once, and for
ever?&rdquo;</p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; <span class="smcap">He was Faithful in his
Stability</span>.</p>
<p>It is sixty-three years since he was ordained to the ministry,
but throughout the whole of that long period he was never known
to waver.&nbsp; And how full of disturbing causes has that whole
period been!&nbsp; The minds of men have been unsettled, and
there has been a general shaking of thought.&nbsp; The stagnation
which prevailed when he commenced his ministry has given place to
a general fermentation, and during those sixty-three years we
have had wave after wave passing over the Church.&nbsp; In his
early days there was great excitement about the gift of tongues
and prophecy under the leadership of that wonderful christian
orator <span class="smcap">Edward Irving</span>.&nbsp; Then
followed what we used to call &ldquo;tractarianism,&rdquo; taught
by that master mind <span class="smcap">Newman</span>, and since
developed in the open Romanism of the Ritualist.&nbsp; Then arose
those who call themselves &ldquo;The Brethren,&rdquo; as if they
alone were children in the Lord&rsquo;s family, and who have <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>done so much to
disturb and unsettle those who have been walking most
conscientiously with God.&nbsp; And lastly, there was wafted from
America what many welcome as a new rule for holiness.&nbsp; In
addition to all which there have been from without the steady
efforts of Popery to pervert the purity, and of Infidelity to sap
the foundations of the faith.&nbsp; So wave has followed wave,
but in the midst of it all our venerable friend was kept firm as
a rock with his principles unchanged, and his faith
unshaken.&nbsp; As a consistent and honest Churchman he rejoiced
in the thirty-nine Articles, and never for one moment wavered in
his fidelity to their clear testimony to the truth of God.&nbsp;
And as a student of sacred Scripture, he clung to the great,
grand distinctive truths of the Gospel, such as atonement through
the substitution of the Lord Jesus, justification by faith, new
birth by the Holy Ghost, sanctification by the Spirit,
preservation through God&rsquo;s unchanging faithfulness, and a
full salvation in all its parts through the free grace that is in
Christ Jesus.&nbsp; These were the great principles of his faith
and ministry all through his life, and through God&rsquo;s mercy
nothing shook him.&nbsp; You may compare the old man of
eighty-six with the boy of sixteen, and you will find no change
in principle.&nbsp; You may compare the last Sermon preached last
year with the first Sermon which was preached in his
father&rsquo;s pulpit in the year 1815, and you will find the
great message substantially the same.&nbsp; As he himself said,
the last time he occupied this pulpit, &ldquo;In the Church where
I was baptized, in the village in which I was born, I began my
ministry on December 24th, 1815.&nbsp; I remember the text was
&ldquo;This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation,
<a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>that Christ
Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am
chief.&rdquo; 1 Timothy i. 15.&nbsp; There I began, there I
continued, there I am still, and there, God helping me, I hope to
end glorying in the Gospel which I know to be the power of God
unto salvation to every one that believeth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(3.)&nbsp; <span class="smcap">He was Faithful in the Fulness
of his Teaching</span>.</p>
<p>If we are to stand stedfast for seventy years, we must have
something solid on which to rest, and one great reason why people
shift about as much as they do, is, that they have no stability
in their principles.&nbsp; The reason of this again very
frequently is that they take partial views of truth.&nbsp; They
are one-sided christians, and so lose their balance; whereas we
want our foundation to be well built, and to rest all round with
an even pressure on the rock.&nbsp; Surely this was most
remarkably the case with the ministry of this faithful man.&nbsp;
He did not clip, or twist, the sacred Scripture to fit his
system, but he was ready to sacrifice the symmetry of his system
in order to bring out the whole teaching of God himself in his
inspired Word.&nbsp; He rested absolutely on Scripture as the
only and sufficient rule of faith, and wherever Scripture led him
there he was prepared to follow.&nbsp; It was this that gave such
a richness, such a fulness, and such a comprehensiveness to his
ministry.</p>
<p>Nothing, for example, could exceed his exhibition of the love
of the Lord Jesus.&nbsp; It was his joy to exalt him as a
Saviour, and to hold converse with him as a friend.&nbsp; But
with all that the love of the Father was always prominent.&nbsp;
The Father&rsquo;s holy law, and the Father&rsquo;s purpose, the
Father&rsquo;s <a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>gift, the Father&rsquo;s covenant, and the Father&rsquo;s
home, were always in view.</p>
<p>And so with reference to the what are termed the doctrines of
Grace.&nbsp; It was the joy of his heart to exalt the grace of
God in all its forms of application: redeeming grace,
predestinating grace, grace in the call, grace in the pardon,
grace in the gift of faith, grace in the new birth, grace in
holiness, grace in preservation, grace never failing till it ends
in glory!&nbsp; And this grace he would preach in its peculiar,
limited, and special application to the Church of God&rsquo;s
elect.&nbsp; But that did not prevent his proclaiming with
unlimited freedom the great offer of eternal life to the sinner,
and throwing on the sinner the whole responsibility of the
acceptance or rejection of the offer.&nbsp; As an illustration, I
never can forget a magnificent Sermon of his, the grandest Sermon
I ever heard from the lips of man, on Eph. v. 25, and never can I
forget the way in which he quoted the text, &ldquo;Christ also
loved the <i>Church</i>,&rdquo; the church of God&rsquo;s elect,
&ldquo;and gave himself for <i>it</i>,&rdquo; or how he pointed
out to us the special and most tender love of the Lord to his
chosen people; but neither on the other hand can I ever forget
the thrilling power with which he gave forth the grand words of
our blessed Saviour, &ldquo;God so loved the <i>world</i> that he
gave his only begotten Son, that <i>whosoever</i> believeth in
him should not perish, but have everlasting life,&rdquo; and on
the strength of these words threw broadcast over the congregation
the free offer of life to the sinner.&nbsp; It was this grand
harmony of gospel truth that gave such a wonderful power to his
ministry.&nbsp; He was not afraid of letting Scripture tell its
own tale, and proclaim <a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>its own message.&nbsp; What he found
there, that he taught, and taught fearlessly, even though he knew
in some instances that it was beyond man&rsquo;s power to fit all
the parts together.&nbsp; He believed the Gospel to be
God&rsquo;s message, revealed in God&rsquo;s word, perfected in
God&rsquo;s purpose, and taught in God&rsquo;s own way; so by
God&rsquo;s help he gave the whole just as he found it, and left
it to the infinity of God himself to bring to light the perfect
harmony of the various parts.</p>
<p>(4.)&nbsp; <span class="smcap">There was a Blessing on His
Faithfulness</span>.</p>
<p>The faithful servants in the parable were able to present to
their master the talents which they had gained during the period
of their trust.&nbsp; In their case therefore, faithfulness led
to fruitfulness.&nbsp; Their work was successful, and there were
talents gained.&nbsp; Can we doubt for one moment that God
blessed in the same manner the faithfulness of our revered
friend?&nbsp; Whatever others may do, I cannot.&nbsp; I have
heard of the deep interest excited by his ministry wherever he
has laboured, in Sheffield, in Jersey, and amongst
yourselves.&nbsp; I am told by a clergyman at Sheffield that his
ministry there was followed by most blessed results in the
awakening and salvation of souls.&nbsp; I am told also that
&ldquo;when upwards of thirty years afterwards he visited that
town, not only were there crowds to hear him, but many came
forward to relate the blessings which either themselves, or their
parents and friends had received through his
instrumentality.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Lord alone knows how <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>many talents
were gathered in all those places, and presented as a
thankoffering to God.&nbsp; But I know a little of what took
place at Richmond.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Mr. Langston</span>
went there very soon after the commencement of his
ministry.&nbsp; Before he went there every thing in that place
was dark, cold, and dead.&nbsp; The glorious Gospel was almost an
unknown message.&nbsp; His ministry there lasted, I believe,
about three years, and after an interval of nearly twenty years,
I followed him as curate of the parish.&nbsp; I have always
regarded it as one of the greatest blessings of my life that I
did so, for there I found a large body of persons from all
classes of society, living consistent, holy lives, and full of
faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, who owed their conversion to Mr.
Langston&rsquo;s ministry.&nbsp; Like Barnabas, I &ldquo;saw the
grace of God,&rdquo; and I am not ashamed of acknowledging that
what I there witnessed as the fruit of his labours has helped to
give a tone to the whole of my subsequent ministry.&nbsp; Most
truly then may I say of that faithful man, &ldquo;He rests from
his labours, and his works do follow him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(5)&nbsp; He was faithful in <span class="GutSmall">HIS
CHILDLIKE TRUST AT THE END</span>; when his work was done, and as
a little child he was simply resting in the arms of his most
blessed Saviour.&nbsp; I do not attach much importance to the
last words of such a man.&nbsp; When a person has been walking
with God for seventy years and more, we do not want last words to
assure us of his faith.&nbsp; But it is pleasant to see how the
old foundations bear, and to watch the last earthly intercourse
of the faithful servant with the faithful Saviour.&nbsp; It was
delightful in this instance to do so.&nbsp; He was sure,
perfectly sure, of his Lord&rsquo;s <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>fidelity; and when it was said to
him, &ldquo;He will never leave us,&rdquo; his reply was
&ldquo;No, never, never.&rdquo;&nbsp; On another occasion as he
lay in the deepest weakness, he said, &ldquo;I am thinking of
that good Scotchman who said, &ldquo;There is nothing so sweet in
all this universe as Christ to die with, and nothing dearer than
his love.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nor was this merely a matter of feeling,
or experience; for he was calmly and intelligently resting on the
great principles of the Gospel.&nbsp; These solid foundation
principles he had preached from the beginning.&nbsp; On these
principles he had lived, and on these principles he died.&nbsp;
It was the thought of redeeming mercy that filled his heart with
gratitude.&nbsp; So that he was heard saying, &ldquo;He became a
curse for me&mdash;left alone&mdash;deserted by his
own.&rdquo;&nbsp; That was his one resting place, and resting
there he used to delight in the hymn&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>OH! Saviour, I have nought to plead,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In earth, beneath, or heaven above,<br />
But just my own exceeding need,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And Thy exceeding love.</p>
<p>The need will soon be past and gone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Exceeding great&mdash;but quickly o&rsquo;er,<br />
The love unbought is all Thine own,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And lasts for evermore!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Till at length nothing could be heard but a few detached
words, but those words were quite sufficient to shew where his
heart was resting.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dear
Saviour&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Looking&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Covenant&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Ordered
and sure&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Thy blood and
righteousness&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Hope&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;End&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Coming
soon&rdquo;&mdash;and <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>then came the message from heaven
itself, &ldquo;Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord,&rdquo; and
the ransomed spirit was free from the burden of the flesh.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>II.&nbsp; For our second subject, <span class="smcap">the
Master&rsquo;s welcome</span>, I have no time left, and perhaps
it is well, for who can attempt either to describe or imagine
it?&nbsp; The words of this passage seem to indicate that the
joys are beyond all proportion greater than any thing seen
here.&nbsp; There are but few things here, but many joys there,
and the many cannot be measured by our notions of the few.</p>
<p>Then again the expression &ldquo;the joy of the Lord,&rdquo;
seems to raise us far above all earthly thoughts, and introduce
us as it were into the very mind of the Lord himself.</p>
<p>It may be understood as the joy which the Lord feels.&nbsp; We
are taught that he has special joy even in heaven.&nbsp; There
was a joy set before him to attain which he endured the
cross.&nbsp; And what is the joy?&nbsp; Is it not in the
ingathering of souls?&nbsp; Is it not when souls are saved, and
many justified, that he sees of the travail of his soul, and is
satisfied?&nbsp; Now surely there must be the same blessed
happiness in those who share his joy.&nbsp; If we rejoice in the
joy of the Lord Jesus, we shall rejoice with those whom he has
gathered around him.&nbsp; As <span class="smcap">Mr.
Langston</span> said in his Sermon on Rev. vii. 15.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The meeting with those Saints will add no little
accumulation of blessedness.&nbsp; I shall see Abel, the first
martyr for Christ; the first witness to the atonement by his
precious blood.&nbsp; I shall see Enoch the first great prophet
who walked with God, and was not, for God took him.&nbsp; I shall
see Noah, <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>the Preacher of righteousness; Melchizedec, king of
righteousness and peace; Moses, Samuel, and all the Prophets,
Evangelists, and Saints.&rdquo;&nbsp; Does he not see them
now?&nbsp; Is he not with them now?&nbsp; But does he not also
see multitudes of precious souls, from Hastings, from Richmond,
from Sheffield, from Jersey, and from Southborough, to whom he
was permitted to convey God&rsquo;s message, and who are now
rejoicing with him before the throne?&nbsp; How many were there
to welcome him at heaven&rsquo;s gate?&nbsp; And may not the joy
of such a meeting be well termed the joy of the Lord?</p>
<p>But besides this, the joy of the Lord must be the joy that is
realized in the presence of the Lord himself.&nbsp; It is all
very well to be with Abel, and Enoch, but what must it be to be
with Christ?&nbsp; This it is that will fill heaven with praise,
and make even eternity too short for our thanksgiving.&nbsp; Do
you remember what he said of the prospect, in the last Sermon he
ever preached to you, &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;What joy
to see him face to face!&nbsp; What joy to see him even now
through the lattice!&nbsp; But what to enjoy that love without
interruption, and without a cloud ever rising between the soul
and the sunshine of his love!&nbsp; Then the seven-fold promises
of revelation, all his own gracious words, will be
fulfilled&mdash;&ldquo;The crown of life.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The
tree of life.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The new name.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;The morning star.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The white
raiment.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The abiding pillar.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;And the share in the throne of the Son of
God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Is not that the joy of the Lord?&nbsp; And is
not that the joy in which the faithful servant has now entered?
is he not there now?&nbsp; Is he not face to face with <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>his
Saviour?&nbsp; Does he not even now see him as he is?&nbsp; Has
he not already experienced the truth of the words, &ldquo;In thy
presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures
for evermore?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now what would he say if he could speak to us from that
presence chamber of God?&nbsp; Do you think he would change his
note, or withdraw his testimony?</p>
<p>What would he say to you believers?&nbsp; Do you think he
would tell you to give up for that your faith is in vain?&nbsp;
Would he not rather say, that the half was not told you, no not
the thousandth part, and that there is such a fulness in Christ
Jesus as when on earth he never had had the least idea of?&nbsp;
Would he not entreat you to cleave to him, to follow him, to love
him, to serve him, to labour for him, and to clasp him to your
heart as the strength of your life, and the joy of your soul?</p>
<p>And what would he say to the unconverted?&nbsp; Would he say
to them that it does not matter whether they are converted or
not, and that he finds that he was mistaken?&nbsp; You may
remember what he said in his farewell Sermon, &ldquo;I think with
grief of those who have not submitted to the Gospel of
Christ.&nbsp; To such, the minister stands in a very awful
position as a witness.&nbsp; Oh, those words, &ldquo;Son
remember!&rdquo;&nbsp; You See how the Father of the faithful
addressed him, owned him as a son, and one of the family, so that
he might have shared its blessing; but he had cast them
away.&nbsp; My unconverted brethren, if you die without Christ,
oh the bitterness of the anguish, and remorse!&nbsp; <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>What must be
the worm that never dies, the fire that is never quenched?&nbsp;
O consider this ye that forget God.&nbsp; He that being often
rebuked, and invited, hardeneth his neck, shall suddenly be
destroyed, and that without remedy.&nbsp; My hearers, what I want
is that your hearts may be given to the Lord.&nbsp; I want Christ
to be enthroned in your hearts.&nbsp; I want you to become His,
to enter in while the door of mercy invites your approach, and to
share all the blessings of everlasting salvation so freely
offered through Christ Jesus the Saviour!&rdquo;&nbsp; Do you
think he would say less now, now that he has seen the great
realities?&nbsp; Oh! how would he plead with you, and how would
he persuade you, and how would he point you to the Lord Jesus
Christ for life!&nbsp; But we shall hear that voice no more on
earth, and we can never again listen to him pleading with
souls.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the message remains, the Redeemer
remains, the salvation remains, the open door still remains, and
may God grant that there may be such a work in each one of us,
that when we pass beyond the veil, we may be welcomed, as we are
sure that he has been, with the words&mdash;&ldquo;Enter thou
into the joy of thy Lord!&rdquo;</p>

law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks

trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
